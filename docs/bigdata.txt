I enjoy building backend applications using Node.js and Express.  
Solving real-world problems with clean code gives me satisfaction.  
Iâ€™m interested in scalable system design and API development.  
Learning about distributed systems and databases fascinates me.  
I like experimenting with new backend frameworks in my free time.  
Creating RESTful services and working with SQL and NoSQL databases is my passion.  
I often contribute to open-source projects and backend dev discussions.  
Cloud computing and containerization are topics I actively explore.  
Reading about software architecture keeps me motivated.  
Teaching others and mentoring new developers is something I find rewarding.
